**MinimalWorker** is a lightweight .NET library that simplifies background worker registration in ASP.NET Core and .NET applications using the `IHost` interface. It offers three simple extension methods to map background tasks that run continuously or periodically, with support for dependency injection and cancellation tokens.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 Register background workers with a single method call
- ⏱ Support for periodic background tasks
- 🔄 Built-in support for `CancellationToken`
- 🧪 Works seamlessly with dependency injection (`IServiceProvider`)
- 🧼 Minimal and clean API

---

## 📦 Installation

Install from NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package MinimalWorker
```

Or via the NuGet Package Manager:

```powershell
Install-Package MinimalWorker
```

## 🛠 Usage

### Continuous Background Worker

```csharp
app.RunBackgroundWorker(async (MyService service, CancellationToken token) =>
{
    while (!token.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        await service.DoWorkAsync();
        await Task.Delay(1000, token);
    }
});
```

### Periodic Background Worker

```csharp
app.RunPeriodicBackgroundWorker(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5), async (MyService service, CancellationToken token) =>
{
    await service.CleanupAsync();
});
```

### Cron-scheduled Background Worker

```csharp
app.RunCronBackgroundWorker("0 0 * * *", async (CancellationToken ct, MyService service) =>
{
    await service.SendDailyProgressReport();
});
```

All methods automatically resolve services from the DI container and inject the `CancellationToken` if it's a parameter.

Workers are automatically initialized and started when the application starts - no additional calls needed!

### Error Handling

All worker methods accept an optional `onError` callback for handling exceptions:

```csharp
app.RunBackgroundWorker(
    async (MyService service, CancellationToken token) =>
    {
        await service.DoRiskyWork();
    },
    onError: ex =>
    {
        // Custom error handling - log, alert, etc.
        Console.WriteLine($"Worker error: {ex.Message}");
        // Worker continues running after error
    }
);
```

**Important**: 
- If `onError` is **not provided**, exceptions are **rethrown** and may crash the worker
- If `onError` **is provided**, the exception is passed to your handler and the worker continues
- `OperationCanceledException` is always handled gracefully during shutdown

#### Using Dependency Injection in Error Handlers

The `onError` callback currently does not support dependency injection directly. As a workaround, you can capture services from the service provider:

```csharp
// Capture logger at startup
var logger = app.Services.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();

app.RunBackgroundWorker(
    async (CancellationToken token) =>
    {
        await DoWork();
    },
    onError: ex =>
    {
        logger.LogError(ex, "Worker failed");
        // Use the captured logger
    }
);
```

**Note**: This captures singleton services. For scoped services, this approach has limitations. Native DI support for error handlers is being considered for a future release.

## 🔧 How It Works

- `RunBackgroundWorker` runs a background task once the application starts, and continues until shutdown.
- `RunPeriodicBackgroundWorker` runs your task repeatedly at a fixed interval using PeriodicTimer.
- `RunCronBackgroundWorker` runs your task repeatedly based on a CRON expression (UTC time), using NCrontab for timing.
- Workers are initialized using **source generators** for AOT compatibility - no reflection at runtime!
- Workers automatically start when the application starts via `lifetime.ApplicationStarted.Register()`
- Services and parameters are resolved per execution using `CreateScope()` to support scoped dependencies.

## 🚀 AOT Compilation Support

MinimalWorker is fully compatible with .NET Native AOT compilation! The library uses source generators instead of reflection, making it perfect for AOT scenarios.

### Publishing as AOT

To publish your application as a native AOT binary:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```

Make sure your project file includes:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <PublishAot>true</PublishAot>
</PropertyGroup>
```

This will produce a self-contained native executable with:
- **No .NET runtime dependency** - runs on machines without .NET installed
- **Fast startup** - native code execution from the start
- **Small binary size** - approximately 4-5MB for a minimal application
- **AOT-safe** - all worker registration happens via source generators, no reflection
